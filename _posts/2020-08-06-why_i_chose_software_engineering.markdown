When I was little I would always tell my mom that the moon was my best friend and that she would follow us at night so that she could protect me. I knew one day that I was going to go to the moon, even if people had already been there I wanted to go there myself. However, I realized quite shortly I do not meet the height requirements to be an astronaut, and I needed to rethink my approach. Throughout my teen years I wasn’t sure what I needed to study to be able to accomplish this and even when I reached college I still didn’t think I made the right choice with my major. I felt lost for a long time until I learned about Margaret Hamilton who was the lead computer scientist during the Apollo mission and if it weren’t for her on-board flight software that was in the Apollo 11 then we would have never made it to the moon, and that’s when I knew.

When I started the Flatiron Bootcamp Prep it came so naturally to me and it was something I was thoroughly enjoying. It’s almost like for once everything was finally falling into place for me. I didn’t feel pressured to prove myself or to overwork myself. Now being a part of the Flatiron Software Engineering course and having connections to people who share the same interests in me, and same desire to grow as much as I do while helping one another, I know I have made the right decision. Whatever comes my way I know that I made the right decision that will not only allow me to support myself and my mother but will also allow me to send someone to the moon again.
