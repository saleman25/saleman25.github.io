As I'm nearing the final days of my Software Engineering program, I’ve thought a lot about what I would’ve done differently or just what I wish I had known sooner.

**DON’T BE SO HARD ON YOURSELF**

There are going to be some people who know more than you or who catch on faster than you do and that is OKAY. You don’t need to compare yourself to others. Even if you don’t understand you can always reach out for help.
NOBODY IS OUT TO GET YOU 
You won’t be made fun of people won’t think you’re dumb. Everyone is there to help you. Your cohort lead(s), your education coach, your peers. Everyone wants to see each other succeed. I know because of my past experience I was scared to reach out but I have truly never had such a positive and welcoming environment where everyone is just so nice and willing to help. PLEASE REACH OUT IF YOU NEED IT

**TAKE A STEP BACK AND BREATHE **

I know things can get overwhelming sometimes, and with a mix of perfectionism and imposter syndrome it’s easy to just want to keep pushing and pushing and pushing. But sometimes it’s best to take a step back. This whole program every project week I have exceeded my own limits as well as put my health last with migraines starting right before project week and then lasting days after I am done. I received good advice from my education coach Gretchen that the brain is a muscle and just like I give myself a rest day from working out my brain needs a rest day too and I can’t stress this enough; it. is. okay. I promise. You won’t get behind, you’re not any less than anyone else if you need a break. It is so easy to get lost in it all but in the end it will always work out.

**REACH OUT **

Whether it be to your cohort lead(s) or to your peers. This is probably the best advice I can give someone. And not just for when you need help, but for anything. This program can be stressful and with so much else going on outside of it, it is really nice to have other people to talk to and open up to. I truly have made the best friends I can possibly ever ask for just from this program and I am so so thankful that even despite a pandemic, despite being miles away, I have found some really good people in my life.

**Also just as an extra point, its never too early to start setting up your linkedin don’t leave it last minute like i did (: 


But regardless of my knowledge that I have right now, I have come a long way and I am a much more confident person and not just in coding but in general. Maybe it’s because I finally found my “calling in life” and I am doing something I truly enjoy, but I feel like I am a better person now. I know when to ask for help, I know when I need to give myself a break. I have an amazing support system in this program and outside of it and its directly because of this. Long story short, be easier on yourself. Ask for help, and you’ll be just fine.
